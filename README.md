# caracal_genomics

This repository contains scripts associated with Kyriazis et al. 2023 bioRxiv, "The influence of gene flow on population viability in an isolated urban caracal population".

The **`genotyping_pipeline`** directory contains scripts for a modified GATK pipeline.

The **`analysis`** directory contains scripts for estimating heterozygosity, calling ROH, running various population structure analyses, and estimating a dadi model from the resulting vcf. 

Finally, the **`simulations`** directory contains scripts for running SLiM simulations exploring future population dynamics in the Cape Peninsula caracal population.
